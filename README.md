# Tic Tac Toe

## What this is

This is an implementation of the popular game, Tic-tac-toe using Reactjs.
I built it as a refresher in Reactjs after being out of the coding game for a month or so.
Seems I still can.

## How to run it

a. Execute the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dmithamo/tic-tac-toe.git
yarn # install all dependencies
yarn start # run the application
```

b. Visit [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000). The game should be playable there.

## What the future holds

I will probably imporve the styling a it. Currently it is the ugliest UI I have ever seen.
Also I might add a leaderboard to keep track of who is winning.
